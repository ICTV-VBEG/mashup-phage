# TODO

* Replace `ICTV-VBEG` and `mashup-phage` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `mashup-phage` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `mashup-phage` with the workflow name (can be the same as `mashup-phage`).
* Replace `louvain community partitioning of mash distances ` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `ICTV-VBEG` and `mashup-phage` were correctly set.
