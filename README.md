# TODO for workflow implementation

Our general aims are to:

1. Follow the best practices regarding snakemake workflow folder structures: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snakefiles/deployment.html#distribution-and-reproducibility
2. Use conda environments for automated software installation: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snakefiles/deployment.html#integrated-package-management
3. Use snakemake wrappers for any steps where they are available: https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/
4. Enable automatic inclusion of the workflow in the snakemake workflow catalog (this should work out-of-the-box, standardized usage can be enabled later): https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?rules=true
5. Use the example data provided for automated testing (continuous integration) of workflow functionality in a `.test/` folder and using GitHub Actions.
